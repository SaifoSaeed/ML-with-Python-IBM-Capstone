# Introduction
As a final step to seal the IBM ML with Python course, I attempted this capstone project to exercise model building, training and fitting.
## Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. k-Nearest Neighbours
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machines
## Metrics
1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
4. F1-Score
5. LogLoss
6. Mean Absolute Error
7. Mean Squared Error
8. R2-Score
## Notes
This project is only intended to give a practical glimpse of working with ML models. It is an entry-level gateway to a much more complex world of much important mathematical notation.
